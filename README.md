Experimenting with [Snowman](https://github.com/glaciers-in-archives/snowman), a static site generator for SPARQL backends, to produce a prototype site for the Boston Research Center's [Chinatown Collections Survey Project](https://bostonresearchcenter.org/bringing-history-together-the-chinatown-collections-survey-project/). 

The SPARQL endpoint used for this site is for a custom Wikibase, currently only accessible through Northeastern University's VPN.
